elbow method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) for k-means. 

pair these clusters with dish-level data. This will help to explore whether specific dishes are framed differently depending on the cuisine, which may provide insights into culinary stereotypes or consumer expectations

(Use metrics similar to prereliability and postreliability (from ART2 networks) to verify that the clusters produced consistent results and adequately represented distinct cultural dimensions.) # haven't done

By reducing the features to 2D or 3D, plot them and see if the clusters overlap or are distinct. 
Topic modeling was done for the negative reviews. 


# for tf-idf
TF-IDF seems to be a bit meaningless for my data as it 
The methodology presented by Gabriela Nathania H. et al. focuses on summarizing hotel reviews using two main approaches: extractive summarization based on TF-IDF scores and feature extraction through Adjective-Noun Pairing. The research aims to create a concise representation of hotel reviews to help users quickly understand the sentiment and key aspects of the hotel experience. 

The clustering approach could be used to group reviews into similar topics or sentiments. 

Adjective-Noun Pairing: Extracting adjectives and nouns can help identify the key features and their qualities that customers comment on. For example, pairing "delicious" with "ramen" or "slow" with "service" could help in understanding specific aspects of customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction?
