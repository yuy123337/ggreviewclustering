# Simiarity and Clustering
This repository contains code for analyzing restaurant reviews using TF-IDF, K-means clustering, and LDA topic modeling. The project aims to analyze reviews of Chinese and Japanese restaurants to uncover insights about consumer preferences, sentiment, and cultural differences. The focus is on food-related themes, service quality, and how these factors influence customer perceptions of ethnic cuisines.

Elbow method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) for k-means. This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that applies Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to topic modeling, extracting key themes from restaurant reviews for both Chinese and Japanese cuisines.

# Data
The review dataset contains customer reviews for Chinese and Japanese restaurants, including text data and metadata like review scores, cuisine type, and other relevant features. The dataset is large and includes millions of records.

Due to the large size of the data, it could not be uploaded directly to this repository. However, you can download the data from the source (or request access) and place it in the appropriate directory for processing. The dataset is expected to be stored in CSV or JSON format and should be pre-processed (e.g., cleaned, tokenized) before running the analysis.

# For tf-idf
TF-IDF seems to be a bit meaningless for my data as it 
The methodology presented by Gabriela Nathania H. et al. focuses on summarizing hotel reviews using two main approaches: extractive summarization based on TF-IDF scores and feature extraction through Adjective-Noun Pairing. The research aims to create a concise representation of hotel reviews to help users quickly understand the sentiment and key aspects of the hotel experience. 

The clustering approach could be used to group reviews into similar topics or sentiments. 

Adjective-Noun Pairing: Extracting adjectives and nouns can help identify the key features and their qualities that customers comment on. For example, pairing "delicious" with "ramen" or "slow" with "service" could help in understanding specific aspects of customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction?
